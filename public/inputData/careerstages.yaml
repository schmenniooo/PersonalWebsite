      I started exploring IT topics on my own outside of class and eventually realized 
      that I could imagine turning it into a career."

  career_stage2:
    title: "Start of Apprenticeship in Software Development"
    date: "2023 – 2026 (expected)"
    description:
      "I decided to leave school before graduating, as I no longer saw value in staying just to obtain a diploma. 
      I wanted to apply my interest and the skills I had already developed. 
      So I began my apprenticeship as an IT specialist in application development at Vector Informatik GmbH. 
      For the first time, I truly felt that I was in the right place."

    title: "Specialization and Personal Growth"
    date: "During Apprenticeship (2023–2026)"
    description:
      "Alongside my apprenticeship, I continuously pursued my goal of becoming a professional software developer. 
      I explored different areas – from embedded systems to enterprise application development. 
      In my free time, I taught myself the fundamentals of web development and discovered a strong interest in 
      software design, user logic, and usability. This phase helped me understand what kind of developer I want 
      to become in future."

  career_stage4:
    title: "Discovery of DevOps and Go"
    date: "2025"
    description:
      "During 2025, my focus shifted towards infrastructure and automation. I began exploring DevOps practices, 
      working with AWS services, Docker containerization, and CI/CD pipelines. This led me to discover Go (Golang), 
      a language that immediately resonated with me due to its simplicity, performance, and strong tooling ecosystem. 
      I started building projects like TrackPilotCRM (mentioned in the projects page) that combined my growing interest 
      in backend development with infrastructure automation. This phase marked a turning point
       – I found the intersection between software development and operational excellence that truly excited me."
