  Project1:
    title: "This personal website"
    description:
      "This website serves as my personal 
      portfolio and was built entirely using React and JavaScript. 
      Its purpose is not only to showcase my career path and projects 
      but also to demonstrate my practical development skills. 
      The site acts as a second, interactive résume — 
      designed with modern web technologies, structured with component 
      logic, and dynamically populated via YAML data. Particular focus 
      was placed on clean design, usability, and technical clarity."

  Project2:
    Title: "Website for my local barber"
    Description:
      "This project was a custom-built website for my local hairdresser, 
      developed using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
      without relying on any frameworks. 
      The goal was to create a clean and functional 
      online presence tailored to the needs of a small business. 
      It includes essential features like service descriptions, 
      contact information, and a personal description of the team-members. 
      I also offered this project as a real, usable website for the salon, 
      making it my first client-oriented work."
