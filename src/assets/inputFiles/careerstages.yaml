      "I decided to leave school before graduating, as I no longer saw value in staying just to obtain a diploma. 
      I wanted to apply my interest and the skills I had already developed.

      For the first time, I truly felt that I was in the right place."

      In my free time, I taught myself the fundamentals of web development and discovered a strong interest in 
      software design, user logic, and usability. This phase helped me understand what kind of developer I want 
      to become in future."
